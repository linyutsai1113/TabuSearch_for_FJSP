## Data Explanation

In the first line there are (at least) 2 numbers:  

1. the number of jobs
2. the number of machines
3. the average number of machines per operation (optional)

Every row represents one job: 

- the first number is the number of operations of that job    
- the second number (let's say k>=1) is the number of machines that can process the first operation;  
then according to k, there are k pairs of numbers (machine,processing time) that specify which are the machines and the processing times 


Example: Fisher and Thompson 6x6 instance, alternate name (mt06)

```

first row: 6 jobs, 6 machines, and 1 machine per operation  
second row: job 1 has 6 operations; the first operation can be processed by 1 machine, that is machine 3 with processing time 1.
